        <td>Hello! I am Sarah Osborne the owner of My Only Sunshine Coffee Shop. Back in January of 2013 I had this bright idea to share my love of coffee, hot cocoa and tasty treats with my community. By coming up with a menu of all of my favorite morning items I have opened up this small shop where I have made it an open place for socializing or for a quick stop on the way to work or class! Check our Daily Lunch Specials page and come join us for lunch Monday - Friday (lunch menu changes daily)!</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>Here at My Only Sunshine we like to pass on a little bit of that sunshine on to our community customers. While in the coffee shop you can purchase a future drink of any size or tasty treat for someone who may just happen to come into the shop that needs a pick me up. By purchasing this item we will give you a piece of stationary to write down who the item is for, the Pay It Forwards are endless and are a good way to spread a little bit of sunshine within our community.</td>
